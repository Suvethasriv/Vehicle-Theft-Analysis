PROBLEM STATEMENT :                                                                                                                     
This system helps in analyzing the theft claims and revert with premium changes based on various aspects of theft.Our proposed system reduces the disadvantage by manually updating the database and producing updated visualized data to the users.The datasets are updated in particular interval of time so that the results visualized are more accurate. Tableau is the technology used to visualize the data. It explores in real time and reacts to change faster.


PROPOSED SYSTEM :                                                                                                                    
In our proposed system the analysis provided are more accurate. The datasets are requested from the insurance agencies to perform the analysis. The analysis for vehicle theft, insurance claims and fraud analysis are performed under single application. The datasets are updated with new data with regular intervals to obtain accurate result. The regions where the motor vehicle theft is high and agents under whom the false insurance claims are made is analyzed and can be visualized using Tableau. The time consumed for performing the analysis is very less.                                                                                                                  
ADVANTAGES :                                                                                                                        
•	Data provided after analysis is accurate.                                                                                             
•	All data are made available in single analysis                                                                                       
•	The regions where the vehicle theft is high are analyzed and listed.                                                                 
•	Whereas in this application current updates are possible.                                                                            


FUTURE ENHANCEMENTS :                                                                                                               
We have proposed an efficient financial system in which the transactions are sim based and the details of customer are securely saved both in system server and web server.
Our project may be enhanced in future by implementing the satellite for an individual organization. So, the speed of transaction through satellite will be very fast.


CONCLUSION :                                                                                                                         
We have proposed an efficient financial system transactions based on sim cards. The details of customer which are registered are saved in the system server and web server in the secured manner. The confidentiality in our project is, unauthorized users cannot hack the transactions. Since the transactions are sim based, it is limited within an individual organization.
